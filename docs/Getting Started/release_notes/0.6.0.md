The 0.6.0 release removes support for scala versions below 2.11, migrates to scalaz-iteratees and adds support for 2.13's new collection approach.

Build wise it's moved to maven and github actions to simplify rolling out any future fixes, similarly the docs have migrated from the home-brew site builder to mkdocs.  The feature scope is: 

1. #51 - Migration from the old IterV to the newer Scalaz iteratee library
2. #52 - Scala 2.13 support

## Scalaz Iteratee

The pull api (and async pull api) remains the same, however user iteratee usage will have to change.  Largely this involves swapping Cont and Done for cont and done and migrating enumeratee / run usage to:

```scala
(iteratee &= iteratorEnumerator(pull.it)) run
```

instead of

```scala
iteratee(pull.it) run
```

this is because enumerators are no longer implicitly bound, things are notably more verbose.  Scalaz provides a good selection of useful starting enumerators.

Also note that Iteratee[E,A] is a type alias for Iteratee[E,Id,A] so everything is "wrapped" in an Id container (Id[X]=X), as such you may need to specify types to get a proper compilation.

## Scala 2.13 support

2.13 re-worked much of the internal collection logic, including CanBuildFrom.  Scales required the ability to swap out the actual container used for Tree's in order to reduce allocation cost (yielding better performance).

As such there is a compatibility layer working around most of this unpleasantness, however for compatibility CanBuildfrom is still implicitly required in the apis.

None of this should affect 2.13 usage but please raise an issue should you find one.
