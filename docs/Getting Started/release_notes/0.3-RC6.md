This is a feature release, adding a the full set of useful XPath Axe, string based XPath evaluation - via a popular open source XPath library, useful equality testing, a lot of new documentation and many smaller improvements in syntax and usability.

This version has been built with xsbt 0.11.x and migrated to [github](https://github.com/chris-twiner/scalesXml).  This releases documentation can be found [here](http://scala-scales.googlecode.com/svn/sites/scales/scales-xml_2.9.2/0.3-RC6/index.html) and provides many examples on how to use Scales Xml.

### All the Axe you'll ever need

Scales 0.3 adds the following axe:

* preceding-sibling (preceding\_sibling\_::)
* following-sibling (following\_sibling\_::)
* descendant (descendant\_::)
* following (following\_::)
* preceding (preceding\_::)
* ancestor (ancestor\_::)
* ancestor-or-self (ancestor\_or\_self\_::)
* descendant-or-self (descendant\_or\_self\_::)

This provides all of the XPath 1 and 2 axe (namespace axis excluded).

### Enhanced internal XPath queries

* position() (pos)
        pos\_<, pos\_==, pos\_>
* last() (last)
        last\_<, last\_==, last\_>
* position() == last() (pos\_eq\_last)
* Easier to extend and re-use queries and axe
        xfilter, xmap, xflatMap

### String base XPath evaluation

* Evaluate normal XPath 1.0 strings to XmlPaths
* Evaluates to an Iterable[Either[AttributePath, XmlPath]] or,
+ get[T] a value directly from XPath 1.0 (e.g. get[String]\("normalize(//\*)")) 
+ Allows querying for the few predicates and XPaths that Scales cannot process (and dynamic queries of course)
+ Optional dependency

### New xpath.Functions

* Unified interface for XPath function handling
* text, QName and Boolean typeclasses
* Implementations for all relevant Scales Xml types
    + string( attribute ) makes sense whilst string( QName ) does not

### New XmlComparison framework (2.9.x only)

* Compare Xml structures and types
* Customisable comparison rules
* Default Scalaz === Equal type classes
* XmlComparison type classes provide full details of differences:
    + A QName based path to the difference
    + The objects which are different

### Extra Fun

* Forwards and Backwards Path Iterators (used by following and preceding)
* DuplicateFilter now works with the Scalaz Equal typeclass
* Using AttributeQNames with the tuple arrow now creates QNames as you'd expect 
* DslBuilder allows direct manipulation of trees via folding
* Simplify the Builder usage why /(<(Elem(... ) when you can just /(Elem)?
* Java 1.7 JAXP implementation checks - Schema validation is optimised (no serialization)

### How To Use

Scales 0.3 moves to Sonatype under the organisation org.scalesxml, with support for 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.9.1 and 2.9.2.  As such add:

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      // just for the core library
      "org.scalesxml" %% "scales-xml" % "0.3-RC6"
      // or, use this instead for String based XPaths (Jaxen, also includes the core)
      "org.scalesxml" %% "scales-jaxen" % "0.3-RC6"
    )

to your xsbt builds or use scales-xml_2.9.2 as the id when using Maven.
