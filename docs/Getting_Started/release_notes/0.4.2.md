This release is a performance update/fix for pull parsing using onQNames / iterate which adds a healthy boost to most usage scenarios ([issue #3](https://github.com/chris-twiner/scalesXml/issues/3)).

Please note that due to ([issue #4](https://github.com/chris-twiner/scalesXml/issues/4)) intransitive() must be added to the libraryDependencies for scales-jaxen and a direct entry for jaxen itself (also intransitive()) should be used - see below.

The 0.4.x releases represent a move to Scalaz 6.0.4, which is binary incompatible with 6.0.3.  See [here](http://posterous.implicit.ly/scalesxml-031) for the 0.3.1 release notes.

### How To Use

Scales 0.4.2 supports for 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.9.1, 2.9.2 and 2.10.0-M6.  As such add:

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      // just for the core library
      "org.scalesxml" %% "scales-xml" % "0.4.2"
      // and additionally use these for String based XPaths
      "org.scalesxml" %% "scales-jaxen" % "0.4.2" intransitive(),
      "jaxen" % "jaxen" % "1.1.3" intransitive()
    )

to your xsbt builds or use scales-xml_2.9.2 as the id when using Maven.
