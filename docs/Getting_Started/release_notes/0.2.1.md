### Matching and JAXP compatibility fixes

Scales 0.2.1 is bug fix release.  Source compatibility is maintained but a recompile is likely necessary.

Barring further bug fixes this is probably the last release before migrating to the new xsbt (which also includes migrating all of the plugins) and introduction of various subprojects.

Fixes include:

* JAXP TrAX compatible with both the Saxon and Sun JDK approach to StAX reading (see issue 1)
* Matching on QName alone (Attribute or Elem) requires calling the .m or .matcher function.

Known issues:

1. Using TrAX for serializing or transforming will not, in the JDK - due to the JDK ignoring them, process PROLOG and end misc items.  Saxon does process this correctly.  Use the scales.traxSourceShouldSerialize system property (set to true) if these events are important to you, its simply much faster.  When left as its non Xalan defaul - _false_ - no extra serialization is required and transformations will be faster (but loose wrapping misc items).
1. Xalan users don't really have choice here as it doesn't support StAX readers for transformations (no StAXStream2SAX)
