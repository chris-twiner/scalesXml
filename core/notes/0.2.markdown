### Performance, Flexibility and Correctness Improvements

Scales 0.2 is an incremental release aimed at improved overall performance for the Xml Pull api and correctness.  

It now reaches my correctness, usability and performance aims from almost 2 years ago when I started the project.

Additional functionality includes:

* XPath union
* Path sorting now allows sorting tuples of (T, Path)

## Performance Improvements

* Iteratee based parsing with onDone (onQNames) is now 40-50% faster and allocates even less memory
* Deep XPath searches (\\\\\\) are 20-25% faster
* XPath non-sorted / duplicate filtered results can be >30% faster (due to evaluation choice)

* Document order sorting and filtering only when required (15-20% faster for exact or non matching XPaths)
* XPath general performance gains of 5-10% and lower memory allocations

## Additional Flexibility For XPath Evaluation Choices

* The developer can now choose to lazily evaluate XPaths
* The resulting Iterable[XPath] can be lazily traversed
* The raw unfiltered and unsorted paths can be traversed

## Correctness Improvements

* Attribute axis results are now typed
* Document order results from Attribute Axis
* XPath union (|) maintains ordering

## Release Improvements

* Reduced dependencies (now only Scalaz, slf4j and commons-codec)
* Removed JUnit test helpers
* Scalaz version upped to 6.0.3
