= Scales Xml ${projectVersion} Overview =

Scales Xml, in addition to immutability, aims to focus on these separate concerns:

; '''Correctness'''
;* XmlItems such as Text, Comments, PIs and CData are not containing nodes, they statically cannot have children and they cannot contain invalid characters 
;* QNames are a fundamental piece of XML and are treated as first class citizens
;* Elements are a QName, the attributes they contain, the namespaces they declare and also do not directly have children
;* Attributes are combinations of either a PrefixedQName or NoNamespaceQName and a value

; '''Structure and manipulation'''
;* Structure of XML (Tree) is separated from the contents of the Xml, allowing maximal re-use
;* Operations on XML (Path - a Zipper over Tree) is separated from both the contents and the structure
;* Changing any update to individual XML Element or Items will not cause cascading changes in the rest of the structure (function of Path)
;* Transformations on XML Trees (via Path) should be composable and simple to follow.
;* The data model is the same for both Push and Pull parsing (with the addition of EndElem for XmlPull)

; '''XML Comprehensions - XPath'''
;* Navigation through XML is either through Path directly or the inbuilt XPath syntax
;* Syntax closely resembles normal XPath leveraging, for example, Paths ability to navigate parents
;* Syntax should separate the navigation of elements from available predicates as far as possible (niceties such as \*QName remain) 
;* Syntax should not rely on string interpretation but on types (QName objects used directly)
;* XPaths are used as a basis for Tree transformation
;* The full XPath axe are available (with the exception of the namespace axis)

; '''Pull API'''
;* Based on javax.xml.stream, allowing optimisations from jaxp/stax upgrades
;* Uses the same types as the SAX based parser
;* Leverages Scalaz Iteratees to provide processing of the event stream
;** You can choose how to process an xml stream, should your code control the flow, the enumerator or a mixture?
;** Immutable transformations on streams
;* Provides an Iteratee to process XPath like locations via a ${cscala}<nowiki>List[QName]</nowiki>${cend}
;* Provides a combinator (onDone) to iterate over ResumableIters allowing simplified XML parsing
;* Scales adds the concept of resumable iteration:

${cscala}
  // think resumable folds without cps plugin
  type ResumableIter[E,A] = IterV[E, (A, IterV[E,_])]
${cend}

; '''Comprehensive Serialization Support'''
;* SerializerFactory / Serializer Typeclasses allow plugable serialization schemes
;* SerializeableXml Typeclass allows serializing of all XML through a single consistent interface
;** Lazily create XML using EphemeralStreams and <nowiki>Iterator[PullType]</nowiki>
;* Developers can customise the serialization process while maintaining correctness
;** Use XHTML style tag ends <el /> for empty elements
;** Serialize your attributes in an order of your choosing
;** Or choose to abandon certain correctness checks in favour of speed when you know that your XML inputs and outputs are always correct

; '''JAXP Support'''
;* XSLT transformation support
;* Conversion to other XML DOMs
;* Use of JAXP serialization - e.g. pretty printing
;* javax.xml.validation support
;* Aims to hide all JAXP implementation inconsistencies

; '''Performance'''
;* Up to 20% faster than scala.xml
;* Lower memory usage than both scala.xml and JAXP/DOM
;* Parsing memory usage can be optimised for given usage
