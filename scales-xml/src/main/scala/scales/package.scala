/**
 * Scales Xml provides both a more flexible approach to XML handling and a simplified way of interacting with XML.  
 *
 * It fits nicely with the Java APIs you know, TrAX and javax.xml.validation for example, allowing you to run XSLTs and convert to and from Scales XML and other DOMs.
 * 
 * It also provides a far more XPath like experience than the normal Scala XML, Paths look like XPaths and work like them too (with many of the same functions and axes).
